I am a doctoral researcher specializing in land resources management. My research focuses on the following areas:

- **Ecosystem Services**: Exploring the benefits that ecosystems provide to humans, including clean water, pollination, and carbon storage.
- **Agricultural Trade**: Investigating the dynamics of agricultural trade and its implications for resource management and sustainability.
- **Virtual Water/Embodied Environmental Impacts**: Analyzing the concept of virtual water and the environmental impacts associated with production and consumption patterns.

I am passionate about integrating these topics to promote sustainable land use practices and inform policy decisions.
